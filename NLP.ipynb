            "purpose of protecting the penis against injury in the bush and attacks\r\n",
            "from insects, has the disadvantage of easily becoming loose and filling\r\n",
            "quickly with water during swimming and wading. After every passage of a\r\n",
            "river reaching above the pubic region a halt had to be made, during\r\n",
            "which my men took off their calabashes and emptied them; then they put a\r\n",
            "new layer of green leaves into the round opening, stuck the penis in,\r\n",
            "and, with the help of the penis pin, pushed it in until it had\r\n",
            "completely disappeared and the calabash lay close to the abdomen.\" When\r\n",
            "sitting round the camp fire, and at other times, the men can be seen\r\n",
            "drawing the pins from their hair and making their toilet. The covering\r\n",
            "of the penis is undoubtedly intended as a protection of the sensitive\r\n",
            "glans. Thus in the Brazilian forest the penis becomes endangered by\r\n",
            "spines of leaves being brushed off the branches and boring themselves\r\n",
            "deeply into the flesh; the spines get torn when pulled out, and cause\r\n",
            "painful inflammations. For warding off insects the women of many Indian\r\n",
            "tribes have tassels hanging in front of the sex organs. In the Northern\r\n",
            "Territory of Australia both men and women wear such tassels. There are\r\n",
            "still greater dangers in the wilderness. In Brazil there exists a small\r\n",
            "fish (_Cetopsis candiru_) which has a tendency towards boring itself\r\n",
            "into any of the exposed orifices of the body. It slips into the urethra,\r\n",
            "and is prevented by its fins from getting out again, and thus may easily\r\n",

            "attempt an impromptu operation by slitting open the urethra with his\r\n",

            "There is no foundation for the assumption of Adolf Gerson that men\r\n",

            "nakedness ultimately lessens the stimulus to excitement. The following\r\n",

            "in the tropics clothes are essentially ornamental; they are worn for\r\n",

            "are raised without any consideration for people present, if there is any\r\n",
            "danger of their becoming soiled or injured. The Malay women in the\r\n",

Vemos algum sentido nas palavras preditas e isso não pode ser descartado.\n",

        "A análise do modelo padrão (v1) sobre a palavra sex é bem interessante. É sabido do choque cultural que os europeus levaram ao longo e após as grandes navegações com os povos de outros continentes. A palavra sex ter como predições as palavras \"promiscuity\",\"fun\" e \"air\". Diz muito sobre os hábitos sexuais dos nativos de outras terras e de como isso chocava o europeu no papel de observador e ao mesmo tempo opressor, já que essas informações foram utilizadas (e ainda são) para a dominação destes povos, seja através do espanto diante da diferença cultural, seja utilizando argumentos que alegam a não-civilização. É interessante perceber que esta análise não foi feita sobre a predição em si, mas demonstra que a predição da v1 está contundente com a realidade dos fatos já conhecidos.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "É interessante perceber ainda com a v1 que a primeira predição para a palavra \"she\" é escaped. Um termo bem sugestivo, relacionado a violência, e ao perigo. Enquanto a palavra \"he\" retorna \"lays\". Enquanto ela foge, ele se deita. Ainda que não valha a pena fazer mais análises, a versão 1 mostra-se bem calibrada em termos de sentido.\n",

A palavra primitive mostra que todas as redes tem alguma efetividade, já que, apesar dela não ser a mais comum ela é de caráter central para a semântica da maioria dos textos, e traz predições condizentes com o esperado em todas as redes.\n",
